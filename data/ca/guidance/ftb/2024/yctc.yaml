# Notes on YCTC calculation:
# 1. Must qualify for CalEITC (or be eligible with limited losses)
# 2. Must have qualifying child under age 6 at end of tax year
# 3. Reduction = excess_income × (credit_amount / 7500)
#    where excess_income = max(0, earned_income - phase_out_start)
# 4. YCTC = max(0, credit_amount - reduction)
