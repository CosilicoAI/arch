There shall be allowed as credits against the taxes imposed by Section 17041 or 17048 all of the following:

(a) A credit of fifty-two dollars ($52) for a single person, for a married person filing a separate return, and for the head of a household.

(b) A credit of one hundred four dollars ($104) for a surviving spouse or for married persons filing a joint return. When one of the spouses was a nonresident for the taxable year, the credit shall be divided equally between them.

(c) A credit of fifty-two dollars ($52) if the individual is 65 years of age or older on the last day of the taxable year.

(d) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a credit of two hundred twenty-seven dollars ($227) for each dependent who meets the requirements of Section 151(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, relating to the dependent.

(2) For each taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2009, and before January 1, 2013, the amount of the credit under paragraph (1) shall be the amount described in subdivision (a).

(3) The credit shall be allowed only if the taxpayer identification number of each dependent for whom a credit is claimed is included on the return for the taxable year.

(4) Effective for each taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2015, a taxpayer identification number for purposes of paragraph (3) means a social security number, an individual taxpayer identification number issued by the Internal Revenue Service, or an adoption taxpayer identification number issued by the Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code, for the dependent for whom a credit is claimed, or alternative identification information prescribed by the Franchise Tax Board. The Franchise Tax Board shall prescribe rules, regulations, or notices to implement this section for taxpayers whose dependents do not have a taxpayer identification number issued under Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code. Those rules, regulations, or notices shall be designed to ensure taxpayer compliance while recognizing the documentation needs and restrictions of those taxpayers whose dependents do not possess or cannot obtain a taxpayer identification number.

(e) A credit for personal exemption of fifty-two dollars ($52) if the taxpayer is blind on the last day of the taxable year.

(f) A credit for personal exemption of fifty-two dollars ($52) in the case of a husband and wife filing a separate return if the spouse is blind.

(g) For purposes of subdivisions (e) and (f), an individual is blind only if his or her central visual acuity does not exceed 20/200 in the better eye with correcting lenses, or if his or her visual acuity is greater than 20/200 but is accompanied by a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, if another taxpayer is allowed a credit under this section for an individual, the amount of the credit under this section for that individual shall be zero.

(i) (1) For each taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1989, the Franchise Tax Board shall recompute the amounts specified in this section in accordance with this subdivision.

(2) The California Department of Industrial Relations shall transmit to the Franchise Tax Board the percentage change in the California Consumer Price Index for all items from June of the prior calendar year to June of the current calendar year, no later than August 1 of the current calendar year.

(3) (A) The Franchise Tax Board shall compute an inflation adjustment factor by adding 100 percent to the percentage change figure that is furnished pursuant to paragraph (2) and dividing the result by 100.

(B) The Franchise Tax Board shall multiply the preceding taxable year's credit amounts by the inflation adjustment factor and round off the resulting amounts to the nearest one dollar ($1).
